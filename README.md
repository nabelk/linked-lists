# Linked Lists

## General Information

-   The project is a part of The Odin Project: Full Stack JavaScript
-   The Linked List project consists of two classes/factories, LinkedList and Node, that provide functionality to work with linked lists.

## Description

### LinkedList Class

-   The LinkedList class represents the entire linked list and provides methods to manipulate and access the list.

#### Methods

-   **append(value)**: Adds a new node with the given value to the end of the list.
-   **prepend(value)**: Adds a new node with the given value to the start of the list.
-   **size()**: Returns the total number of nodes in the list.
-   **headNode()**: Returns the first node in the list.
-   **tailNode()**: Returns the last node in the list.
-   **at(index)**: Returns the node at the given index in the list.
-   **pop()**: Removes the last element from the list.
-   **contains(value)**: Checks if the provided value exists in the list.
-   **find(value)**: Returns the index of the node containing the provided value, or null if not found.
-   **toString()**: Represents the LinkedList object as a string.
-   **insertAt(value, index)** that inserts a new node with the provided value at the given index.
-   **removeAt(index)** that removes the node at the given index.

### Node Factory

-   The Node factory represents an individual node in the linked list.
-   **value**: The value stored in the node.
-   **nextNode**: A reference to the next node in the list.

## Usage

To run the script, you need to have Node.js installed on your computer.

Once you have Node.js installed, follow these steps to run the implementations:

1. Save or git clone this repo
2. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the repo directory
3. Change & modify the script.
4. Run script

    ```
    node script.js

    ```

5. The output will be displayed in the terminal or command prompt.
